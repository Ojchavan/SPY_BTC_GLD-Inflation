However, the correlation between Bitcoin and inflation is -0.01, and the correlation between gold and inflation is -0.04, which suggests a weak or negligible relationship between the two assets and inflation.

    "Similar to gold, Bitcoin isn't tied to a particular currency or economy. It also isn't controlled by a small group of companies or stakeholders. Rather, it is an international asset class that reflects global demand. In times of high U.S. inflation, investors must take on more risk to offset the decline in existing asset values. For example, a 3% dividend yield may normally supplement income in retirement. But if inflation is 6%, it simply isn't good enough. Bitcoin could be one of the better options outside of equities because it sidesteps many of the political and economic risks associated with the U.S. stock market. In this vein, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are one of the most practical and simple ways for an American to diversify away from purely American revenue, income, and assets.\n",

    "Lessons about gold’s track record as an investing hedge may be learned by looking back at the 1970s, when the U.S. experienced its last bout of high inflation.Oil price shocks and energy shortages drove average annual U.S. inflation up to around 8.8% from 1973 to 1979. During those six years, gold won over many investors as a top inflation hedge, since the yellow metal generated an impressive 35% annual return."
